# sketch
A pixel like sketch pad based on an Etch-A-Sketch. An assignment from the Odin Project.

Allows a user to select a number of pixels in a 960px sqaure area. Then when the mouse is rolled over the boxes/pixels disappear. Doesn't work well when going over 70.

*Update*: Squares now take 3 pass overs with the mouse to fade completely out.
